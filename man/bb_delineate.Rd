\usage{
bb_delineate(
  bbasin_ids,
  germanyshape,
  polygon_col = "objectid",
  geb = "geb_kz_num",
  gew = "gew_kz_num",
  remove_artifical = TRUE,
  check_border = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{bbasin_ids}{vector with primary basin IDs for one or more gauging stations}

\item{germanyshape}{basin shapefile as a \code{sf} object; can be generated with \code{\link[=bb_readgermanyshape]{bb_readgermanyshape()}}.}

\item{polygon_col}{name of primary basin ID column in shapefile germanyshape}

\item{geb}{name of domain column ('Gebietskennzahl'), default = 'geb_kz_num')}

\item{gew}{name of water body column ('Gew√§sserkennzahl', default = 'gew_kz_num')}

\item{remove_artifical}{logical, should artificial water bodies such as canals be removed from procedure?}

\item{check_border}{logical, if TRUE  it is checked if the delineated catchment area intersects the outer boundary of the basinshapefile, a flag is returned}

\item{plot}{logical, if TRUE plots are saved in one pdf for each bbasin_id, useful for quality checking the results}

\item{plot_dsn}{character, defines path to save plots (if plot TRUE)}

\item{stations}{\code{sf} point object with station ids corresponding to bbasin_ids, (only needed if plot TRUE)}

\item{station_id_col}{character with  column name of station ids in \code{stations}, (only needed if plot TRUE)}

\item{plot_rivers}{river shapefile as a \code{sf} line object or character with rivers file name to plot (if plot TRUE), default NULL. If NULL no rivers to plot}

\item{coastal_area}{logical, should coastal waters be flagged? (not yet implemented)}
